Docker allows you to leverage pre-built and ready-to-use container images. If an application consists of multiple components such as a database, a front-end, and a back-end, you can deploy multiple containers and link them together.

In the first blog, you looked at the Ops Perspective of Docker. I installed Docker and downloaded an image, started a new container, logged in to the new container, ran a command inside it, and then destroyed it.

## The Dev Perspective

In this blog, my topic is building a custom container to leverage network automation tools like Netmiko and other network libraries. As you know, most of these tools are built on Python and run in a Linux environment. Isolating your tools in a container can avoid dependency issues. You can use containers from Docker Hub as a base for your container, make a directory and place two empty files in it.

```bash
$ tree
.
├── app.py
└── Dockerfile

0 directories, 2 files
```

The file `app.py` is a Netmiko script that will be put into the new container image. The contents of the file are:

```python
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

# Create a dictionary for a particular Device
R1 = {'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
      'ip': '10.10.10.9',
      'username': 'admin',
      'password': 'cisco'}

net_connect = ConnectHandler(**R1)

# Sending a command to the Device
output = net_connect.send_command("show ip int br")
print(output)
```

Next, you need to write the `Dockerfile`, which contains the actual build instructions, as shown below:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:slim-bullseye

LABEL name="Python Automation"
LABEL maintainer="sydasif78@gmail.com"

RUN apt-get update

RUN pip install --upgrade pip \
&& pip install netmiko

WORKDIR /home

COPY app.py /home
```

Let’s walk through the Dockerfile:

- `FROM` loads the base image.
- `LABEL` adds metadata.
- `RUN` executes commands inside the container.
- `WORKDIR` sets the working directory.
- `COPY` adds your Python script to the container.

Use the `docker build` command to create a new image using the Dockerfile. Run the command from within the directory containing the app code and Dockerfile:

```bash
$ docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t automation .
```

Sample output:

```terminal
REPOSITORY   TAG             IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
automation   latest          828154ade6ae   6 seconds ago   199MB
python       slim-bullseye   ba94a8d11761   3 days ago      125MB
```

Run a container from the image and test the app:

```bash
$ docker run --name netmiko -it automation bash
root@daf6ab851974:/home# ls
app.py
```

Execute the Python script:

```bash
root@daf6ab851974:/home# python app.py
```

This command connects us to a bash shell at `/home` inside the container. All tools installed during the build are available. Use the `exit` command to leave the container.

## Sharing Docker Images

You can share your container images to Docker Hub. First, log in:

```bash
$ docker login
```

Tag the existing image:

```bash
$ docker image tag automation sydasif78/python:latest
```

Push it to Docker Hub:

```bash
$ docker image push sydasif78/python:latest
```

Now you have a functional container ready for network automation projects. In the next blog, I’ll show how to connect this container to a network in GNS3 to test the image.
