VLANs and subnetting are foundational concepts in network design. They help segment networks for security, performance, and manageability.

### Key Points:

- **VLANs**: Logically separate networks on the same physical hardware.
- **Subnetting**: Divide a network into smaller, manageable pieces.

This guide covers the basics and best practices for both.
