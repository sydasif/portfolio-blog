Python has become an essential tool for network engineers. Its simplicity, extensive libraries, and large community make it an ideal choice for network automation.

### Key Python Libraries for Networking:

1.  **Netmiko**: For SSH connections to network devices.
2.  **NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support)**: For a unified API to interact with different network operating systems.
3.  **Requests**: For interacting with REST APIs on network controllers or devices.

Learning Python can significantly enhance your capabilities as a network engineer.
